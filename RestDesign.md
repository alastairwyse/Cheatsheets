### Endpoint/path design and naming
* Follow REST resource model paradigm (need link)... it's geared towards CRUD operations on data elements
* Follow a standard model for verbs which don't fit in REST
    Can try and turn verbs into nouns, or use a pattern like google
* Consistency is key
* Defining both data types and keys to identify those data types in the path



### TODO

  Resource model
  Endpoint naming
  Exceptions
  Content type
  General guides like MS and Google
